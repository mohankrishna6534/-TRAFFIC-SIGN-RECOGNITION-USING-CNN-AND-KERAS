# -TRAFFIC-SIGN-RECOGNITION-USING-CNN-AND-KERAS
TSRS (Traffic Sign Recognition System) may plays a significant role in self driving car, artificial driver assistances, traffic surveillance as well as traffic safety. 
Traffic sign recognition is necessary to overcome the traffic related difficulties. The traffic sign recognition system has two parts of indentification which are
localization and recognition.To classify the images into their respective categories, we will build a CNN model
(Convolutional Neural Network). CNN is best for image classification purposes. We will be taking advantage of Kerasâ€™ Sequential API to build our TrafficSignNet
CNN .
